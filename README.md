# Satoshi's Twitterbot

![Beautiful, isn't it.](satoshis_images/latest_canvas.png?raw=true "Lightning wonderland")

A twitter interface to upload images to satoshis.place, and to post the canvas to twitter.
Mention the bot in a tweet with an image, and it will respond with an invoice. If you pay the
invoice with Lightning the image will be uploaded to satoshis.place. It will be 100x100 pixels, so will cost 10000 satoshis. Every time you upload a picture the place will move so they don't end up over eachother.
